# Hacktoberfest Contributor Generator

This is a Node.js tool to generate a list of GitHub users who made valid contributions to a project for Hacktoberfest. The list will be sorted by number of contributions, and will provide a formatted Markdown document with the list of contributors.

## How to Use

Want to [run it yourself?](https://docs.nhcarrigan.com/#/hacktoberfest-contributor-generator/usage)

## Logging

The results of a run will also be written to `/results/_runLog.log` so you can audit any excluded PRs if needed. Note that this is a running log, which means if you run this script more than once each run will be appended to the file.

For convenience, runs are broken up by `==RUN BEGIN==` and `==RUN END==`.
